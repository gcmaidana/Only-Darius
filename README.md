# Only-Darius

This program will pick only the champion Darius when playing League of Legends. This is a work in progress. 
The program selects the champion properly and it runs, but only if you run the program in the game lobby. I will continue to add functionality
so that the selection occurs without fail no matter when you start running the program, e.g.: whether in the game lobby or at the start screen, etc.
Currently, I think I am going to add a FlowHandler class because I think there's an API request that tells you whether you're currently in the lobby, in a game, etc.
I need to mess around with the API more to figure out a solution.
The code is commented to some degree, but I will add more comments and make everything more readable after I finish and refactor everything.

The motivation behind this project is that Darius is my favorite champion and I want others to experience how great Darius is.

**GitHub resizes images, so I am not going to upload the splash art of Darius on this repository, instead I am going to call the image from where [Riot Games hosts the image](https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Darius_0.jpg), in order to preserve the quality of the image because GitHub is compressing the jpg and making it smaller if I upload the splash art. This splash art that is being linked is part of the Data Dragon repository that Riot Games maintains and [all of which can be used by third-party developers](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#data-dragon).**
