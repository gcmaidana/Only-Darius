# Only-Darius

This program will pick only the champion Darius when playing League of Legends. This is a work in progress. 
The program selects the champion properly and it runs, but only if you run the program in the game lobby. I will continue to add functionality
so that the selection occurs without fail no matter when you start running the program, e.g.: whether in the game lobby or at the start screen, etc.
