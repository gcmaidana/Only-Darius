# Only-Darius

This program will pick only the champion Darius when playing League of Legends. This is a work in progress. 
The program selects the champion properly and it runs, but only if you run the program in the game lobby. I will continue to add functionality
so that the selection occurs without fail no matter when you start running the program, e.g.: whether in the game lobby or at the start screen, etc.
Currently, I think I am going to add an FlowHandler class because I think there's an API request that tells you whether you're in the lobby, in game, etc.
I need to mess around with the API more to figure out a solution.

The code is commented to some degree, but I will add more comments and make everything more readable after I finish and refactor everything.
